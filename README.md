# Entry Register Automation for SHAMSEN NAHAR KHAN HALL, CUET
The Entry Register Automation for SNK Hall entails the development and implementation of an automated late entry management system for Shamsen Nahar Khan Hall, CUET, addressing the existing manual process governing late entries for female students. Currently, female students are subject to a 7 pm in the winter season and 8 pm in the summer season, requiring permission from hall authorities, specifically the hall provost, to enter the hall after the designated time. This process involves providing detailed explanations for the late entry, which are recorded in a physical entry notebook. The envisioned system seeks to modernize and streamline this process by introducing an online platform where students can request permission for late entry. This platform will enable students to input essential details such as their name, room number, contact information, and reason for arriving late. Upon submission, the system will automatically notify the hall authority and hall provost, expediting the approval or denial process. Furthermore, the proposed system will replace the traditional entry notebook with a digital log, recording all late entries and associated details. This digital log will be accessible to authorized personnel for monitoring and tracking purposes, ensuring transparency and
accountability in late entry management.
