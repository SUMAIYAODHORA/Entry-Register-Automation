## Overview
The Entry Register Automation for SNK Hall aims to modernize the manual process of late entry for female students at Shamsen Nahar Khan Hall, CUET. Currently, students need permission from hall authorities to enter the hall after the designated time, which is recorded in a physical entry notebook. The system will introduce an online platform for students to request late entry permission, allowing them to input their details and notify the authorities. The system will also replace the traditional notebook with a digital log, recording late entries and their associated details, ensuring transparency and accountability.
